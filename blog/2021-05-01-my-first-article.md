The way I handle imposter syndrome.
In the beginning, I occasionally felt it, but now it seldom ever happens.
1. "Relax it's normal, I'm feeling this way because I'm learning something new," I tell myself whenever I start to feel it.
2. Learning to code is always a good idea, so take it all in, enjoy yourself, be a sponge!
3. I joke with myself that if that Frank Abagale figure can travel the world pretending to be an aviator and a doctor, then with hard work and a dedication to learn I can become a developer.
